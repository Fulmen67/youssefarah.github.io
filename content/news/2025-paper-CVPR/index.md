I attended **CVPR** in Nashville to present my work on event-based motion
segmentation and to connect with the event-based vision community.

Highlights:

- Meeting researchers working on neuromorphic sensing, self-driving
  perception, and high-speed control.
- Seeing new ideas on using event cameras for **color perception** inspired
  by biology (e.g., cuttlefish vision) and how this can unlock even faster
  perception pipelines.
- Discussing how event-based perception can give a competitive edge in
  robotics, autonomous driving, and other time-critical systems.
